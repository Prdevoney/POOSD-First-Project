Push Edits to Server: 

    1. Connect to the server using PuTTY with IP address and Root Pass. 

    2. Username: root
       Password: POOSD-2024-Spring 

    3.  Use command: cd /var/www/html 

    4. use command "git pull" 
        This will pull all the edits that we have commited to the project thus far, and automatically update the website. 

Git Commits Show in Jira (this is totally optional, just thought it would be good to learn): 

    1. When commiting a change write at the begining of the commit message: "PB-x" 
        1.1. Where x is the number of the task in Jira. 
        1.2. The task number will be next to the blue checkmark on the task icon. 

    2. Now you can go to Jira, click on the task you were working on, and see the commit 
       that you just made that relates to that task. 

Connect to Server with PuTTY: 

    1. Install PuTTY for Windows from: https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.80/w64/putty-64bit-0.80-installer.msi
        It will start downloading as soon as you click that link. 
        I don't know what to do if you have a Mac. 

    2. Navigate to where you installed PuTTY on your computer and open "putty.exe"

    3. Paste in the IP address where it says "Host Name"

    4. click "open" 

    5. Login with:
